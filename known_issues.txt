# Jeve Interpreter Status Report

## Working Features
- Basic interpreter functionality with primitive types (int, float, string, boolean)
- Variable assignments and operations
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Garbage collection for non-array objects
- Memory usage tracking and reporting
- Debug functions for monitoring garbage collection

## Known Issues
1. Array Implementation Issues
   - The current array implementation has deadlock/infinite recursion issues
   - Tests with arrays get stuck in an infinite loop or deadlock during execution
   - The recursive nature of array destruction might cause stack overflow
   
2. Memory Management Problems
   - Potential circular references in array values
   - Complex ownership semantics that are difficult to reason about
   - Inefficient memory usage due to excessive object creation
   
3. Java-like Memory Features
   - The -Xms and -Xmx parameters work for controlling overall memory
   - However, the underlying array implementation needs redesign

## Recommendations
1. Simplify Value Class:
   - Remove dynamic memory allocation for arrays
   - Use a simpler value representation without pointer indirection
   - Implement a clear ownership model

2. Redesign Array Implementation:
   - Use a flat vector-based implementation instead of nested objects
   - Implement reference counting at a higher level (GC-managed)
   - Avoid recursive operations on arrays

3. Memory Management Improvements:
   - Implement a region-based allocator for Values
   - Add generational garbage collection for better performance
   - Implement object pooling for commonly used types

4. Development Process:
   - Start with a minimal working set (no arrays) and build incrementally
   - Add extensive testing for memory edge cases
   - Benchmark memory usage for different operations

## Next Steps
1. Use the non-array parts of the interpreter which are working correctly
2. Redesign the array implementation from scratch with simpler semantics
3. Address circular reference issues with proper marking in garbage collection
4. Implement array optimizations like COW once the basic functionality works
