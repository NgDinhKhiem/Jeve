Value Class Issues:

1. Potential circular references:
   - The current Value class implementation might have circular references issues, especially with arrays containing other arrays.
   - This could lead to memory leaks or infinite recursion during destruction.

2. Complex memory management:
   - Our implementation uses dynamic memory allocation which complicates ownership and lifetime management.
   - The copy-on-write semantics added complexity without clear benefits.

3. Recursive destruction:
   - When a Value containing an array of Values is destroyed, it might trigger recursive destruction.
   - This can lead to stack overflow for deeply nested arrays.

4. Potential issues in operators:
   - The copy and move constructors/assignment operators may not be handling all edge cases correctly.
   - This could lead to memory leaks or double-free errors.

5. Inefficient memory usage:
   - Each array element creates multiple objects and pointers, leading to high memory overhead.

6. Serialization issues:
   - The toString() implementation might cause infinite recursion for self-referential structures.

7. Deadlock potential:
   - Concurrent operations on shared values could potentially deadlock due to complex ownership patterns.

Recommendations:
1. Simplify the Value class to a variant-like structure without dynamic allocations.
2. Use std::vector<Value> directly for arrays instead of pointer indirection.
3. Implement proper copy semantics without shared or complex ownership.
4. Consider using a garbage-collected approach with global reference tracking.
5. Implement basic memory pooling for Values to reduce allocation overhead.
6. Switch to a non-recursive algorithm for operations on nested structures.
