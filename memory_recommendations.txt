Memory Usage Analysis and Recommendations for Jeve Interpreter

1. Current Memory Issues:
   - The interpreter is creating an extremely large number of objects (145,636+) even for simple array operations
   - This suggests a potential memory leak or inefficiency in the interpreter's implementation
   - Even with a 100MB memory limit, the interpreter quickly runs out of memory

2. Potential Causes:
   - Parser may be creating too many AST nodes during parsing
   - Array operations (creation, access, concatenation) may be inefficient
   - Garbage collection may not be properly cleaning up unused objects
   - Object reference counting may have circular references preventing cleanup

3. Recommendations:
   a) Improve Memory Tracking:
      - Add more detailed memory logging to identify which operations consume the most memory
      - Track memory usage by object type to identify which objects are being created in large numbers
      - Add timestamps to memory logs to correlate memory usage with specific operations

   b) Optimize Array Implementation:
      - Use a more efficient array representation that minimizes object creation
      - Implement copy-on-write semantics for arrays to avoid unnecessary copies
      - Consider using a single contiguous memory block for array elements instead of individual objects

   c) Enhance Garbage Collection:
      - Implement a more aggressive garbage collection strategy
      - Add cycle detection to break circular references
      - Consider using a generational garbage collector to focus on short-lived objects

   d) Reduce Object Overhead:
      - Minimize the size of object headers
      - Use object pooling for common object types
      - Consider using value types for simple values (numbers, booleans) instead of heap objects

   e) Memory Limit Controls:
      - Add configurable memory limits for different parts of the interpreter
      - Implement memory usage throttling to prevent runaway memory consumption
      - Add warnings when memory usage approaches limits

4. Immediate Actions:
   - Profile the interpreter to identify memory hotspots
   - Implement a debug mode that tracks object creation and destruction
   - Add memory usage reporting to the interpreter's API
   - Create benchmarks to measure memory efficiency improvements

5. Long-term Strategy:
   - Consider redesigning the interpreter's memory management system
   - Evaluate alternative garbage collection algorithms
   - Implement a tiered memory management system with different strategies for different object types
   - Add memory usage analytics to help users optimize their code
